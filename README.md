Let p1 is the rocket and one of the foci is the celestial body. By changing theta(rotation of ellipse), focus1 position, and focus2 position, the ellipse will change accordingly. 

This is helpful when saving orbits and is more accurate when docking to rockets. The orbit is also more stable compared to physics engine (applying gravity formula).
